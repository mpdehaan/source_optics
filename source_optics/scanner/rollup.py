class Rollup:

    """
    The rollup class is responsible for building the statistics table.  First it computes
    daily totals by looking at commits and file change records recorded by the Commit class.
    From there, we can work on Weekly rollups and Monthly rollups of that data.  These are still
    time ranged. Lifetime rollups also exist, but are NOT time ranged (obviously?). And all of
    these types of rollups exist for each author and if the author is None, that represents an
    entire repository.  It's a lot of calculation, which is why this is all a backend CLI
    command and not done within the life of a request. Performance upgrades can always be
    made and are always welcome - the thing that will make the system do the most work is
    repositories with thousands of authors, scaling with commits doesn't really increase
    the amount of queries performed, though a very long source code history does
    take a little longer than a shorter one.
